A.I - Implemented BFS, DFS, A* Algorithms to solve the 8-puzzle problem. The python program prints the results to output.txt

`bfs (Breadth-First Search)`   
 `dfs (Depth-First Search) `  
 `ast (A-Star Search)`    
 
## How to use   
Below are the args that you need to pass along with file, you can choose ast/bfs/dfs one of the algorithm at a time, and next arg is the sequence of initial state of 8-puzzle.        
`python driver_3.py "ast/bfs/dfs" 0,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1`      
 
## Output File Format   
Output file output.txt shows the sample output of the algorithm.         
`path_to_goal: ['Right', 'Down', 'Down']`      
`cost_of_path: 3   `    
`nodes_expanded: 12   `    
`search_depth: 3   `   
`running_time: 0.6345   `     
`max_ram_usage: 19`
