A.I - Implemented BFS, DFS, A* Algorithms to solve the 8-puzzle problem. The python program prints the results to output.txt

`bfs (Breadth-First Search)
 dfs (Depth-First Search)
 ast (A-Star Search)`
 
## How to use

`python driver_3.py ast 0,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1`

## Output File Format

`path_to_goal: ['Right', 'Down', 'Down']
cost_of_path: 3
nodes_expanded: 12
search_depth: 3
running_time: 0.6345
max_ram_usage: 19`
